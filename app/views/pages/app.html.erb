<h1>About this app</h1>
<p>This app was built over a weekend with Fedora 20, SublimeText, Spotify and lots of coffee :) It's built with Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, and uses Mandrill for a transactional email service. It's under version control <a href="https://github.com/jdspiral/jdapp" target="_blank">here</a>.I plan to use it as a blog in the future, and if you snoop around enough I'm sure you'll see some struture is here.
